#Introduction
print ("This is a code designed to help me learn Machine learning in the military. \nwhile also figuring out a way to reduce the amount of food waste and \nstreamline cafeteria operations, thereby reducing operating costs. \n\nSergeant Hyun Sang Harrison Park\n")
#Notes
print ("Actual data unable to be used due to operational security issues in the military.")
#Features: 
#x1:Number of People to Feed
#x2:Popularity Score for Dish
#x3:What day of the Week? (Schedule, sleepiness)
#x4:Temperature - more likely to be hungry in colder environments, and crave high calorie dishes. 

#You would want to make sure that there's no food waste, but would also have to make an extra effort not to have too little food. 

#Demonstrate how big of a problem by showing how much food is wasted regularly. 

#Speed up the Data analysis (through gradient descent) by converting to similar scales, and normalizing around the mean for all feature vectors.
