#Introduction
print "This is a code designed to help me learn Machine learning in the military. \nwhile also figuring out a way to reduce the amount of food waste and \nstreamline cafeteria operations, thereby reducing operating costs. \n\nSergeant Hyun Sang Harrison Park\n"
#Notes
print "Actual data unable to be used due to operational security issues in the military."
#Features: 
#x1:Number of People to Feed
#x2:Popularity Score for Dish
#x3:What day of the Week? (Schedule, sleepiness)
#x4:Temperature - more likely to be hungry in colder environments, and crave high calorie dishes. 
#x5:Holiday/rain (No activity)? 
#x6:During Training?
#x7:Activity level of the day?

#You would want to make sure that there's no food waste, but would also have to make an extra effort not to have too little food. 

#Demonstrate how big of a problem by showing how much food is wasted regularly. 

#Speed up the Data analysis (through gradient descent) by converting to similar scales, and normalizing around the mean for all feature vectors.
